def random_mixexp(n, p, lda, rng=None):
    r"""Generate samples from mixture of exponential distributions

    Simulate a mixture of two or three random exponential distributions.
    This uses a special definition for the probabilities (:math:`p_i`).  In
    the two-process case, :math:`p` represents the proportion of "fast" to
    "slow" events in the mixture.  In the three-process case, :math:`p_0`
    represents the proportion of "fast" to "slow" events, and :math:`p_1`
    represents the proportion of "slow" to "slow" *and* "very slow" events.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Output sample size.
    p : float or array_like
        Probabilities for processes in the output mixture sample.
    lda : array_like
        array_like with :math:`\lambda` (scale) for each process.
    rng : Generator
        Random number generator object.  If not provided, a default one is
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    `ndarray`

    Examples
    --------
    Draw 1000 samples from a mixture where the first process occurs with
    :math:`p < 0.7` and the second process occurs with the remaining
    probability.
