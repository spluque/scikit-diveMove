"""Top-level class for interacting with diveMove

The :class:`TDR` class aims to be a comprehensive class to encapsulate the
processing of `TDR` records from a NetCDF data file.

Processing includes detection and quantification of periods of major
activities in a TDR record, calibrating depth readings to generate
summaries of diving behaviour. These procedures include wet/dry phase
detection, zero-offset correction (ZOC) of depth, detection of dives, as
well as proper labelling of the latter, among others utilities for the
analysis of TDR records.

All core procedures are encapsulated in :class:`TDR`, and are controlled by
a set of user-defined variables in a configuration file, and systematically
executed systematically by function :func:`calibrate`. This function can be
used as a template for custom processing using different
sequences. User-defined variables can also be directly specified as a
dictionary, which is a class attribute. The standard approach follows the
logical processing sequence described below:

1. Zero-offset correction
2. Detection of wet phases
3. Detection of dives
4. Detection of dive phases
5. Speed calibration (if required)
6. Calculation of statistics

Class :class:`TDR` methods implement these steps. This module instantiates
an `R` session to interact with low-level functions and methods of package
`diveMove`.
